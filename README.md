### FYI

alpha os is my idea which is to develop the Indonesian OpenWrt community so that it can grow even overseas (China already has looking), in the sense that we have to make an innovation that appears and is new, not the existing one, made our version, Mr. Sibondt once they said 'jalan ditempat komunitas indo', that's what moved my heart to make an innovation that I named alpha os (alpha = initial version, because it hasn't been perfect until now 😁)
